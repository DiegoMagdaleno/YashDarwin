//:title: Yash manual - Bg built-in

The dfn:[bg built-in] resumes a job in the background.

[[syntax]]
== Syntax

- +bg [{{job}}...]+

[[description]]
== Description

The bg built-in sends the SIGCONT signal to the specified job.
As a result, the job is resumed in the background (if it has been suspended).

The name of the job is printed when the job is resumed.

The built-in can be used only when link:job.html[job control] is enabled.

[[operands]]
== Operands

{{job}}::
The link:job.html#jobid[job ID] of the job to be resumed.
+
More than one job can be specified at a time.
The current job is resumed if none is specified.
+
The percent sign (+%+) at the beginning of a job ID can be omitted if the
shell is not in the link:posix.html[POSIXly-correct mode].

[[exitstatus]]
== Exit status

The exit status of the bg built-in is zero unless there is any error.

[[notes]]
== Notes

The bg built-in is a link:builtin.html#types[semi-special built-in].

The POSIX standard provides that the built-in shall have no effect when the
job is already running.
The bg built-in of yash, however, always sends the SIGCONT signal to the job.
