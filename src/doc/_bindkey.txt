== Description

When executed with the +-l+ (+--list+) option, the built-in lists all
available link:lineedit.html#commands[line-editing commands] to the standard
output.

When executed with one of the other options, the built-in prints or modifies
key bindings for the link:lineedit.html#modes[editing mode] specified by the
option:

- Without {{key}} or {{command}}, all currently defined bindings are printed
  to the standard output in a form that can be parsed as commands that
  restore the current bindings when executed.
- With {{key}} but without {{command}}, only the binding for the given {{key}}
  is printed.
- With {{key}} and {{command}}, {{key}} is bound to {{command}}.
