//:title: Yash manual - Complete built-in

The dfn:[complete built-in] generates completion candidates.
This built-in can only be executed from completion functions during
link:lineedit.html#completion[command line completion].

[[syntax]]
== Syntax

- +complete [-A {{pattern}}] [-R {{pattern}}] [-T] [-P {{prefix}}] [-S {{suffix}}] [-abcdfghjkuv] [[-O] [-D {{description}}] {{word}}...]+

[[description]]
== Description

The built-in generates completion candidates according to the specified
arguments.
No matter how candidates are generated, only candidates that match the word
being completed are generated.

[[options]]
== Options

+-A {{pattern}}+::
+--accept={{pattern}}+::
Only accept candidates that match the link:pattern.html[pattern] specified by
this option.
When more than one of this option is specified, only candidates that match all
of the patterns are generated.

+-D {{description}}+::
+--description={{description}}+::
Give a description of the {{word}} candidates.
The description is shown beside the candidates in the candidate list.

+-O+::
+--option+::
The candidates are treated as command line options.
A hyphen is prepended to each candidate that is treated as an option.

+-P {{prefix}}+::
+--prefix={{prefix}}+::
Ignore {{prefix}} of the word being completed when generating candidates.
The specified {{prefix}} must be initial part of the word.
+
If the word being completed is `file:///home/user/docume` for example, the
command line `complete -P file:// -f` will generate pathname candidates that
complete `/home/user/docume`.

+-R {{pattern}}+::
+--reject={{pattern}}+::
Reject candidates that match the link:pattern.html[pattern] specified by this
option.
When more than one of this option is specified, only candidates that match
none of the patterns are generated.

+-S {{suffix}}+::
+--suffix={{suffix}}+::
Append {{suffix}} to each generated candidate.

+-T+::
+--no-termination+::
Do not append a space after the word is completed.
Without this option, a space is appended to the completed word so that you do
not have to enter a space before the next word.

option, the +-S / -T+ options are assumed.

Generated candidates for link:job.html#jobid[job IDs] do not have leading
percent signs (+%+).
If the word being completed starts with a percent sign, the +-P %+ option
should be specified.

[[operands]]
== Operands

Operands are treated as completion candidates.

[[exitstatus]]
== Exit status

The exit status of the built-in is zero if one or more candidates were
generated, one if no candidates were generated, or larger than one if an error
occurred.

[[notes]]
== Notes

The complete built-in is a link:builtin.html#types[semi-special built-in]. In
the POSIX standard, it is defined as a command with unspecified behavior.
