//:title: Yash manual - Dot built-in

The dfn:[dot built-in] reads a file and executes commands in it.

[[syntax]]
== Syntax

- +. [-AL] {{file}} [{{argument}}...]+

[[description]]
== Description

The dot built-in reads the specified {{file}}, parses its contents as
commands, and executes them in the current link:exec.html#environment[command
execution environment].

If {{argument}}s are specified, link:params.html#positional[positional
parameters] are temporarily set to them.
The positional parameters will be restored when the dot built-in finishes.
If no {{argument}}s are specified, the positional parameters are not changed.

If {{file}} does not contain any slashes, the shell searches
link:params.html#sv-path[+$PATH+] for a readable (but not necessarily
executable) shell script file whose name is {{file}} in the same manner as
link:exec.html#search[command search].
If no such file was found, the shell searches the current working directory
for a file unless in the link:posix.html[POSIXly-correct mode].
To ensure that the file in the current working directory is used, start
{{file}} with `./'.

[[options]]
== Options

+-A+::
+--no-alias+::
Disable alias substitution while parsing.

+-L+::
+--autoload+::
Search link:params.html#sv-yash_loadpath[+$YASH_LOADPATH+]
instead of link:params.html#sv-path[+$PATH+],
regardless of whether {{file}} contains slashes.
The {{file}} value is not considered relative to the current working
directory.

The dot built-in treats as operands any command line arguments after the first
operand.

[[operands]]
== Operands

{{file}}::
The pathname of a file to be read.

{{arguments}}...::
Strings to which positional parameters are set while execution.

[[exitstatus]]
== Exit status

The exit status of the dot built-in is that of the last command executed.
The exit status is zero if the file contains no commands to execute and
non-zero if a file was not found or could not be opened.

[[notes]]
== Notes

The dot built-in is a link:builtin.html#types[special built-in].

A link:interact.html[non-interactive] shell immediately exits with a non-zero
exit status if the dot built-in fails to find or open a file to execute.

The POSIX standard defines no options for the dot built-in;
the built-in accepts no options in the POSIXly-correct mode.

The POSIX standard does not define the {{arguments}}... operands.
It is an error to specify the {{arguments}}... operands in the POSIXly-correct
mode.
