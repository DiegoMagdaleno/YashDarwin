[[description]]
== Description

The export built-in is equivalent to the link:_typeset.html[typeset built-in]
with the +-gx+ option.

[[notes]]
== Notes

The export built-in is a link:builtin.html#types[special built-in].

The POSIX standard defines the +-p+ option only;
other options cannot be used in the link:posix.html[POSIXly-correct mode].
The POSIX does not allow using the option together with operands.
