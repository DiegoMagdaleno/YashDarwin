//:title: Yash manual - Hash built-in

The dfn:[hash built-in] remembers, forgets, or reports command locations.

[[syntax]]
== Syntax

- +hash {{command}}...+
- +hash -r [{{command}}...]+
- +hash [-a]+
- +hash -d {{user}}...+
- +hash -dr [{{user}}...]+
- +hash -d+

[[description]]
== Description

When executed with {{command}}s but without options, the built-in immediately
performs link:exec.html#search[command path search] and caches {{command}}s'
full paths.

When executed with the +-r+ (+--remove+) option, it removes the paths of
{{command}}s (or all cached paths if none specified) from the cache.

When executed without options or {{command}}s, it prints the currently cached
paths to the standard output.

With the +-d+ (+--directory+) option, the built-in does the same things to the
home directory cache, rather than the command path cache.
Cached home directory paths are used in link:expand.html#tilde[tilde
expansion].

[[options]]
== Options

+-a+::
+--all+::
Print all cached paths.
+
Without this option, paths for built-ins are not printed.

+-d+::
+--directory+::
Affect the home directory cache instead of the command path cache.

+-r+::
+--remove+::
Remove cached paths.

[[operands]]
== Operands

{{command}}::
The name of an external command (that does not contain any slash).

{{user}}::
A user name.

[[exitstatus]]
== Exit status

The exit status of the hash built-in is zero unless there is any error.

[[notes]]
== Notes

The shell automatically caches command and directory paths when executing a
command or performing tilde expansion, so normally there is no need to use
this built-in explicitly to cache paths.

Assigning a value to the link:params.html#sv-path[+PATH+ variable] removes all
command paths from the cache as if +hash -r+ was executed.

The POSIX standard defines the +-r+ option only:
other options cannot be used in the link:posix.html[POSIXly-correct mode].

The hash built-in is a link:builtin.html#types[semi-special built-in].
