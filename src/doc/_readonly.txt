- +readonly [-pxX] [{{name}}[={{value}}]...]+

== Description

The readonly built-in is equivalent to the link:_typeset.html[typeset
built-in] with the +-gr+ option.

[[notes]]
== Notes

The readonly built-in is a link:builtin.html#types[special built-in].

The POSIX standard defines the +-p+ option only;
other options cannot be used in the link:posix.html[POSIXly-correct mode].
The POSIX does not allow using the option together with operands.
