The dfn:[suspend built-in] suspends the shell.

[[syntax]]
== Syntax

- +suspend [-f]+

[[description]]
== Description

The suspend built-in sends a SIGSTOP signal to all processes in the process
group to which the shell process belongs.
The signal suspends the processes (including the shell).
The suspended processes resume when they receive a SIGCONT signal.

If the shell is link:interact.html[interactive] and its process group ID is
equal to the process ID of the session leader, the shell prints a warning
message and refuses to send a signal unless the +-f+ (+--force+) option is
specified.
(In such a case, there is no other job-controlling shell that can send a
SIGCONT signal to resume the suspended shell, so the shell could never be
resumed.)

[[options]]
== Options

+-f+::
+--force+::
Suppress warnings that would prevent the shell from sending a signal.

[[exitstatus]]
== Exit status

The exit status is zero if the signal was successfully sent and non-zero
otherwise.

[[notes]]
== Notes

The suspend built-in is a link:builtin.html#types[semi-special built-in]. In
the POSIX standard, it is defined as a command with unspecified behavior.
