//:title: Yash manual - Typeset built-in

The dfn:[typeset built-in] prints or sets variables or functions.

[[syntax]]
== Syntax

- +typeset [-gprxX] [{{variable}}[={{value}}]...]+
- +typeset -f[pr] [{{function}}...]+

[[description]]
== Description

If executed without the +-f+ (+--functions+) option, the typeset built-in
prints or sets link:params.html#variables[variables] to the standard output.
Otherwise, it prints or sets link:exec.html#function[functions].

If executed with the +-p+ (+--print+) option, the built-in prints the
variables or functions specified by operands.
Without the option, it sets variables or functions.
If no operands are specified, it prints all existing variables or functions,
regardless of whether the +-p+ (+--print+) option is specified.

[[options]]
== Options

+-f+::
+--functions+::
Print or set functions rather than variables.

+-g+::
+--global+::
When setting a new variable, the variable will be a global variable if this
option is specified.
Without this option, the variable would be a link:exec.html#localvar[local
variable].
+
When printing variables, all existing variables including global variables are
printed if this option is specified.
Without this option, only local variables are printed.

+-p+::
+--print+::
Print variables or functions in a form that can be parsed and executed as
commands that will restore the currently set variables or functions.

+-r+::
+--readonly+::
When setting variables or functions, make them read-only.
+
When printing variables or functions, print read-only variables or functions
only.

+-x+::
+--export+::
When setting variables, link:params.html#variables[mark them for export],
so that they will be exported to external commands.
+
When printing variables, print exported variables only.

+-X+::
+--unexport+::
When setting variables, cancel exportation of the variables.

[[operands]]
== Operands

{{variable}} (without {{value}})::
The name of a variable that is to be set or printed.
+
Without the +-p+ (+--print+) option, the variable is defined (if not yet
defined) but its value is not set nor changed.
Variables that are defined without values are treated as unset in
link:expand.html#params[parameter expansion].

{{variable}}={{value}}::
The name of a variable and its new value.
+
The value is assigned to the variable (regardless of the +-p+ (+--print+)
option).

{{function}}::
The name of an existing function that is to be set or printed.

[[exitstatus]]
== Exit status

The exit status of the typeset built-in is zero unless there is any error.

[[notes]]
== Notes

A global variable cannot be newly defined if a local variable has already been
defined with the same name.
The local variable will be set regardless of the +-g+ (+--global+) option.

The typeset built-in is a link:builtin.html#types[semi-special built-in]. In
the POSIX standard, it is defined as a command with unspecified behavior.

The link:_export.html[export] and link:_readonly.html[readonly] built-ins are
equivalent to the typeset built-in with the +-gx+ and +-gr+ options,
respectively.
The link:_local.html[local built-in] is equivalent to the typeset built-in
except that the +-f+ (+--functions+) and +-g+ (+--global+) options cannot be
used.
