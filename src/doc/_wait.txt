The dfn:[wait built-in] waits for jobs to terminate.

[[syntax]]
== Syntax

- +wait [{{job}}...]+

[[description]]
== Description

The wait built-in waits for background jobs to terminate.
If link:job.html[job] control is enabled, stopped jobs are considered as
terminated.

The built-in can be used to wait for link:syntax.html#async[asynchronous
commands] if job control is disabled.

If the shell receives a signal while the built-in is waiting and if a
link:_trap.html[trap] has been set for the signal, then the trap is executed
and the built-in immediately finishes (without waiting for the jobs).
If the shell receives a SIGINT signal when job control is enabled, the
built-in aborts waiting.

If the shell is link:interact.html[interactive],
link:job.html[job-controlling], and not in the link:posix.html[POSIXly-correct
mode], the job status is printed when the job is terminated or stopped.

[[operands]]
== Operands

{{job}}::
The link:job.html#jobid[job ID] of the job or the process ID of a process in
the job.

If no {{job}}s are specified, the built-in waits for all existing jobs.

If the specified job does not exist, the job is considered to have terminated
with the exit status of 127.

[[exitstatus]]
== Exit status

If no {{job}}s were specified and the built-in successfully waited for all the
jobs, the exit status is zero.
If one or more {{job}}s were specified, the exit status is that of the last
{{job}}.

If the built-in was aborted by a signal, the exit status is an integer (&gt;
128) that denotes the signal.
If there was any other error, the exit status is between 1 and 126
(inclusive).

[[notes]]
== Notes

The wait built-in is a link:builtin.html#types[semi-special built-in].

The process ID of the last process of a job can be obtained by the
link:params.html#sp-exclamation[+!+ special parameter].
You can use the link:_jobs.html[jobs built-in] as well to obtain process IDs
of job processes.
