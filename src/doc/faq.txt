[[unicode]]
== How can I use Unicode (non-ASCII) characters?

You need to set locale environment variables to enable Unicode character
support.

If the variables have already been configured for your preference, you
probably don't have to do anything. To check the current locale
configurations, you can use the +locale+ command:

----
$ locale
LANG=
LC_CTYPE="en_US.utf8"
LC_NUMERIC="en_US.utf8"
LC_TIME="en_US.utf8"
LC_COLLATE="en_US.utf8"
LC_MONETARY="en_US.utf8"
LC_MESSAGES="en_US.utf8"
LC_PAPER="en_US.utf8"
LC_NAME="en_US.utf8"
LC_ADDRESS="en_US.utf8"
LC_TELEPHONE="en_US.utf8"
LC_MEASUREMENT="en_US.utf8"
LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_US.utf8"
LC_ALL=en_US.utf8
----

In this example, the +locale+ command shows that all the locale setting
categories are configured for the English language, the United States region,
and the UTF-8 encoding.

If the current configuration does not seem to match your preference, set the
+LC_ALL+ variable like this:

----
export LC_ALL=en_US.utf8
----

If you want to use other languages, regions, or encodings, you have to set the
variable to a different value. Please consult your OS's documentation to learn
how to configure these variables in detail.

If you want to apply the same configuration every time you start yash, write
the command in ~/.yashrc or ~/.yash_profile.

If yash still rejects Unicode characters being entered, see the section below
regarding line-editing.

[[lineediting]]
== Line-editing does not work

First, type +echo $TERM+ and see if it prints a _sane_ value. +xterm+ is the
safest value that should work on any existing environment. Colored versions
like +xterm-16color+ and other terminal types like +rxvt+ and +vt100+ may also
work. All possible values can be listed by the +toe+ command. It's most
desirable to choose a value that matches the actual terminal type you are
using, but it might not work if the terminal type you chose is not supported
on the system on which yash is running. If so, try changing the +TERM+ value
by +export TERM=xterm+, for example, to find a value that works.

If line-editing works but you have trouble entering Unicode (non-ASCII)
characters, try enabling the link:lineedit.html#options[le-no-conv-meta]
option by +set -o le-no-conv-meta+.
