dfn:[Yet another shell] (yash) is a command line shell for UNIX-like operating
systems. The shell conforms to the POSIX.1-2008 standard (for the most parts),
and actually is more conforming than other POSIX-conforming shells. Moreover,
it has many features that are used for interactive use, such as command
history and command line editing.
